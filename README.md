**Software Engineer | Game Developer | Cybersecurity Enthusiast**  
*Bridging the gap between game development, AI innovation, and cybersecurity.*  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Eduardo Silva, a passionate software engineer and game developer with a strong focus on high-performance systems, AI, and graphics programming. I love challenges and puzzles, which is why I also explore penetration testing in my free time—it feels like the ultimate challenge to me.  

My passion for computers started when I was very young, with the dream of creating my own games. Since then, technology has become my job, my passion, and my hobby.
