**Software Engineer building game engines, exploring AI systems, and breaking security boundaries.**

From childhood dreams of creating games to professional software engineering, I've transformed my passion into expertise across game development, graphics programming, and cybersecurity. Currently based in Cuxhaven, Germany, working at a startup while developing my own game engine and pursuing advanced penetration testing certifications.

## Why Follow This Journey

I document the intersection of low-level systems programming, game architecture, and security research. Whether you're interested in Vulkan rendering pipelines, custom engine development, or penetration testing methodologies, my repositories showcase practical implementations rather than theoretical concepts.

## Technical Focus

**Game Engine Development**  
Building a custom engine from scratch using Vulkan for rendering and modern C++ design patterns. The architecture prioritizes modularity, performance, and extensibility for complex game systems including physics, networking, and AI.

**Graphics Programming**  
Implementing advanced rendering techniques including path tracing, deferred rendering, and compute shader optimizations. Projects demonstrate understanding of GPU architecture and graphics APIs at the driver level.

**Cybersecurity Research**  
Exploring penetration testing methodologies, reverse engineering, and vulnerability analysis. Preparing for CPTS certification while documenting security research findings and tool development.

**AI Integration**  
Applying machine learning and LLM technologies to game development, focusing on procedural content generation and intelligent NPC behavior systems.
